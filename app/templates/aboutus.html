    <!-- Our purpose -->
    <div style="border:black solid 4px;">
        <p class="p-3">
            We are creating an educational website to help young adults, ages 18-24, 
            learn about credit cards. 
            Almost one in two adults do not have a credit card or have low credit 
            scores due to ineffective financial literacy education 
            and impulsive shopping habits. However, people with low-credit card
            scores pay thousands more in interest when borrowing money. 
            We want to effectively help people get higher credit card scores by teaching 
            them in an engaging way.
