            While credit cards offer many benefits, they can also be risky if not used responsibly. 
            This course will provide an overview of credit cards, how they work, and how they are similar and different from debit cards.

        <p  style="font-weight:bolder;">What are Credit Cards?</p>
        <p>
            Credit cards are a type of payment card that allows consumers to borrow money to make purchases. 
            Credit cards are issued by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. 
            Credit cards have a credit limit, which is the maximum amount that a consumer can borrow at any given time.

        <p style="font-weight:bolder;">What is Credit?</p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Credit </span>is the ability to borrow money or access goods or services with the understanding that youâ€™ll pay later. 
            A <span style="font-weight:bolder;">credit score </span>is a numerical rating representing the perceived ability of a person to fulfill their financial commitments, 
            based on an analysis of their credit history and financial circumstances.

        <p style="font-weight:bolder;">How Do They Work?</p>
        <p>
            To make a purchase with a credit card, the consumer presents the card to the merchant, 
            who processes the payment through a card reader. The consumer receives a statement each month that 
            outlines the transactions made with the card and the amount owed. Credit cards have an interest rate, 
            which is the cost of borrowing money. If the consumer does not pay the balance in full each month, 
            interest will be charged on the outstanding balance. Minimum payments are required each month, 
            but paying only the minimum amount due can result in the consumer paying more in interest over time.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p style="font-weight:bolder;">Why are they important?</p>
        <p>
            If you have a higher credit score, you can get lower interest rates. 
            Here are some people who care about your credit score:
