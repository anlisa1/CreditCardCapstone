    <br><br>
    <div>
        <p>
            Debt is the amount of money borrowed by an individual or an
            entity, usually from a lender such as a bank or a financial institution, 
            that needs to be repaid over a specific period of time. Debt has interest, and can take various forms. 
            They can be considered either good or bad depending on your purpose and management of the debt.

                goods and services that are paid back at a later time.

            <li style="padding:1%;">

        <p>
            Good debt is debt that is used to purchase assets or generate income, such as a 
            mortgage for a home or student loans for education. Bad debt, on the other hand, 
            is debt that is used to purchase liabilities or 
            items that decrease in value, such as credit card debt for unnecessary purchases.

        <p style="font-weight:bolder;">The Cost of Debt</p>
        <p>
            When poorly managed, you may need to pay a lot of more than the amount borrowed. 
            This may come in the form of interest rates, fees, and penalties. The cost of debt 
            can vary depending on the type of debt, your credit score, and the credit card you have.
            High-interest rates and fees can make debt more expensive and difficult to manage, 
            while low-interest rates can make it easier to pay off debt over time.
